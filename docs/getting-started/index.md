# Getting Started

This section walks you through setting up your environment, installing the gem, building the native extension, and running your first vector search.

1. **[Prerequisites](prerequisites.md)** — Install the required system dependencies (CMake, ICU4C, a C++17 compiler).
2. **[Installation](installation.md)** — Install the gem. Pre-building the C++ library with Homebrew makes `gem install zvec` finish in ~10 seconds instead of ~10 minutes.
3. **[Quick Start](quick-start.md)** — Define a schema, create a collection, insert documents, and query by vector similarity.
