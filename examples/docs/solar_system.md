# The Solar System

Our solar system consists of the Sun, eight planets, dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. The four inner planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars — are rocky terrestrial worlds. The outer planets — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune — are gas and ice giants with extensive ring systems and many moons.

Earth is the only known planet to support liquid water on its surface and harbor life. Mars has polar ice caps and evidence of ancient river channels, making it a target for exploration. Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a storm larger than Earth that has raged for centuries. Saturn's rings are made of ice and rock particles ranging from tiny grains to house-sized boulders.

The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter contains millions of rocky bodies. Beyond Neptune, the Kuiper Belt is home to dwarf planets like Pluto and Eris. The Sun contains 99.8% of the solar system's total mass and generates energy through nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium.
