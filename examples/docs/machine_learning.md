# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where algorithms learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. Supervised learning uses labeled training data to predict outcomes, while unsupervised learning discovers hidden structure in unlabeled data.

Neural networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes that transform input signals through weighted connections and activation functions. Deep learning uses many layers to learn hierarchical representations. Common architectures include convolutional networks for images and transformers for natural language processing.

Training involves minimizing a loss function using gradient descent and backpropagation. Overfitting occurs when a model memorizes training data instead of generalizing. Techniques like regularization, dropout, and cross-validation help prevent overfitting. Embeddings convert discrete data like words into continuous vector representations that capture semantic similarity.
