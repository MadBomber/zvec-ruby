# Ruby Programming Basics

Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language designed for developer happiness and productivity. Everything in Ruby is an object, including numbers and strings. Ruby uses duck typing and supports multiple programming paradigms including functional and imperative styles.

Classes are defined with the `class` keyword and support single inheritance with mixins via modules. Blocks, procs, and lambdas provide powerful closure mechanisms for iteration and callbacks. The standard library includes collections like arrays and hashes with rich enumerable methods for mapping, filtering, and reducing data.

Ruby gems are packages distributed through RubyGems.org and managed with Bundler. Popular frameworks built in Ruby include Rails for web development and RSpec for testing.
