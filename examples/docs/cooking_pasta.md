# Cooking Pasta Like an Italian

Great pasta starts with quality dried pasta and generously salted boiling water. Use at least one liter of water per 100 grams of pasta and add salt until it tastes like the sea. Drop the pasta in when the water reaches a rolling boil and stir immediately to prevent sticking.

Cook the pasta one to two minutes less than the package directions for al dente texture. Reserve a cup of the starchy cooking water before draining. The starchy water is the secret to a silky sauce — it emulsifies fat and binds everything together.

Finish the pasta in the sauce pan, tossing with cooking water, butter or olive oil, and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Classic sauces like cacio e pepe, aglio e olio, and carbonara rely on technique and a few high-quality ingredients rather than complexity. Never rinse cooked pasta unless making a cold salad.
