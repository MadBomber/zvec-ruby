# HTTP Protocol and Web Servers

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. Clients send requests to servers using methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Each request includes headers, a URL path, and optionally a body containing data.

Web servers listen on ports (typically 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS) and respond with status codes such as 200 OK, 404 Not Found, or 500 Internal Server Error. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning each request is independent. Cookies and sessions are used to maintain state across multiple requests.

HTTPS adds encryption via TLS to protect data in transit. Modern web applications use REST APIs that follow HTTP conventions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 introduce multiplexing and improved performance over earlier versions.
